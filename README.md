Purpose of the assignment
This individual assignment familiarise with the techniques and skills involved in designing and creating static webpages utilising validated HTML and CSS created with a standard text editor. These Web pages are deployed on a Unix / Apache server. Moreover, it will provide with an appreciation of the separation of structure and presentation which has been discussed in the lecture series.
The Web site I have developed will describe a service to hire. The Web site consist of 3 Web pages linked by a menu. These include:
1. An introductory page (index.html)
2. One or more product description pages (product1.html, product2.html, etcâ€¦)
3. A page with personal details (about.html).

All pages have relevant content to service including text and image, validated to HTML5 without errors and well-formed XML, styled by a validated CSS file, linked to each other via a menu and deployed on Mercury.
